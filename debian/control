Description: utilities for managing Linux-VServer guests
 util-vserver provides the components and a framework to setup virtual
 servers.  A virtual server runs inside a Linux server. It is nevertheless
 highly independent. As such, you can run various services with normal
 configuration. The various vservers can't interact with each other and
 can't interact with services in the main server.
